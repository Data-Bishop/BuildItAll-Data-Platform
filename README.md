# Scalable E-commerce Big Data Platform
## Background
BuildItAll is a European consulting firm specialized in helping small and mid-sized companies build scalable Data Platforms. After securing ‚Ç¨20M in Series A funding, BuildItAll was approached by a Belgian e-commerce client who generates massive amounts of data daily and wanted to become more data-driven.

Our team was tasked with setting up a cost-optimal, scalable Big Data Processing platform based on Apache Spark on the cloud.
This product demonstrates the proposed architecture and solution for enabling large-scale data ingestion, processing, and analytics capabilities for the client.
