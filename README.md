# Scalable E-commerce Big Data Platform
## Background
BuildItAll is a European consulting firm specialized in helping small and mid-sized companies build scalable Data Platforms. After securing ‚Ç¨20M in Series A funding, BuildItAll was approached by a Belgian e-commerce client who generates massive amounts of data daily and wanted to become more data-driven.

Our team was tasked with setting up a cost-optimal, scalable Big Data Processing platform based on Apache Spark on the cloud.
This MVP (Minimum Viable Product) demonstrates the proposed architecture and solution for enabling large-scale data ingestion, processing, and analytics capabilities for the client.

## Overview
The platform is designed to efficiently handle big data workloads while staying true to BuildItAll's core value of building cost-effective cloud solutions.
It uses AWS, Apache Spark, and Terraform to process large datasets efficiently.
It is designed to be cost-effective, easy to maintain, and ready for client onboarding.
